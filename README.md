### Dr. Maya Reynolds 

This is a professional, responsive landing page designed for a high-end therapy practice. The design focuses on calm, trust, and a clear user journey for patients seeking help with trauma, anxiety, and burnout.

# Project Overview
Role: Lead Developer & UI Designer

Goal: Create a "digital sanctuary" that reduces patient anxiety and encourages bookings.

Key Features: Arched imagery, mobile-responsive grids, and a structured "Roadmap to Recovery."

# Tech Stack & Development Note
Framework: React.js

Styling: Custom CSS (Modular)

Design: Mobile-First Responsive Design

**Note on Tech Stack: Since I am still learning Next.js and Tailwind CSS, I built this in React to make sure the final website looked professional and worked correctly. My priority was delivering a high-quality user experience while I continue to master Next.js for future versions.**

# Visual Narrative
Hero 1: Introduces the Doctor immediately to build trust.

Process Section: Provides a 3-step roadmap to lower the barrier for new patients.

Service Grid: Uses symbolic imagery (Butterfly for EMDR, Breathe for Anxiety) to communicate relief.

Intro Section: Provides the clinical background and philosophy of the practice.

# Mobile Experience
The site is fully optimized for mobile devices. The three-column service grid and process steps stack vertically to ensure a smooth "thumb-friendly" experience for users on the go.
